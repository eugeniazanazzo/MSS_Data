# MSS Solver #

This repository contains the local search-based software developed to solve the Medical Student Scheduling Problem (MSS), as proposed by Akbarzadeh and Maenhout in their paper ["An exact branch-and-price approach for the medical student scheduling
problem"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305054821000010#s0085).

In addition to the solver, the repository includes the instances used for testing and the corresponding best solutions identified by our **Multi-Neighborhood Simulated Annealing** solver.
